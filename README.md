<h1>MCDiscordLink REST API</h1>

This API is yet to be hosted, the domain for this API is also still undecided.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Authorization</h3>
To use this API you must have a Token generated by the django aplication directly and include this token in the request headers as shown below:

```json
{"Authorization": "Token <Token goes here>"}
```

<h3>JSON Data</h3>
For some requests you need to provide JSON data, the required data should mimic the data payload shown below:

```json

    "code": "12345", // Must be a 5 digit code, required field
    "minecraft_name": "ExHiraku", // Required field
    "discord_id": "957437570546012240" // Optional Field
}
